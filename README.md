# ALTARN-Tabular-Residual-Neural-Network-for-Alzheimers-Disease-Classification

(Accepted, IEEE FMLDS 2025)

Early and accurate prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from accessible clinical data remains a significant challenge in healthcare. This study proposes ALTARN, a tabular attention residual neural network architecture for robust classification of AD through heterogeneous patient data from a publicly available dataset of 2149 subjects, with medical, demographic, and lifestyle variables organized as structured tabular data. With sigmoid attention mechanisms for the dynamic reweighing of input variables for each patient, deep residual connections capturing complex, and non-linear relationships in tabular features, we developed ALTARN: an early AD prediction tool. ALTARN achieved an average cross-validated training accuracy of roughly 92.73%, alongside robust validation metrics, including an average accuracy of 85.06%, average precision of 80.73%, mean recall of 76.18%, and a mean validation F1-score of 78.32% when evaluated through five-fold stratified validation. When tested against other approaches, ALTARN meets and also exceeds the performance of supervised deep learning models for non-imaging AD classification. This further illustrates that deep neural network based approaches with tabular attention offer a promising direction for interpretable diagnosis of AD via non-imaging medical data.
